# Pull statistics from Tesla API into InfluxDB in Go

Project inspired by https://github.com/lephisto/tesla-apiscraper, completely rewritten in [Golang](https://golang.org). 

InfluxDB scheme is compatible with the original project. The same Grafana Dashboards could be used to visualize the timeline.
